## Project Overview
This project investigates the erosion of human oversight in AI-supported academic and professional workflows. As AI systems increasingly prioritize seamless automation, users may experience reduced visibility into uncertainty, data handling, and governance processes.

Phase 1 focuses on background research, stakeholder analysis, market exploration, and design-thinking planning. No solutions or prototypes have been developed at this stage.

## Project Phase
This repository currently contains materials for **Phase 1: Research & Planning**.
